I’ve removed the bounding box logic and streamlined the script to only draw and transform the full pose overlay. Now you can:

    Drag the entire skeleton overlay with the mouse.

    Scale the entire pose up or down by pressing B (cycles from 0.5× to 2.0×).

    Start playback with S.

Let me know if you’d like any further tweaks!
